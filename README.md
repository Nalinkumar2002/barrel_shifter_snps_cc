In this repository, It gives a detailed report on the design of a 8x4 Right Barrel Shifter using NMOS Pass Transistor logic using 28nm technology node. This design is implemented and simulated using **Synopsys Custom Design Compiler** for the event [_Cloud Based Analog IC Design Hackathon_](https://hackathoniith.in) conducted by the [Department of Electrical Engineering at IIT Hyderabad](https://ee.iith.ac.in), and sponsored by [Synopsys India](https://www.synopsys.com/company/contact-synopsys/office-locations/india/about-synopsys-india.html) and [VLSI System Design (VSD) Corp.](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com)
