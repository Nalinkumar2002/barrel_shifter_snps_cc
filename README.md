In this repository, It gives a detailed report on the design of a 8x4 Right Barrel Shifter using NMOS Pass Transistor logic using 28nm technology node. This design is implemented and simulated using **Synopsys Custom Design Compiler** for the event [_Cloud Based Analog IC Design Hackathon_](https://hackathoniith.in) conducted by the [Department of Electrical Engineering at IIT Hyderabad](https://ee.iith.ac.in), and sponsored by [Synopsys India](https://www.synopsys.com/company/contact-synopsys/office-locations/india/about-synopsys-india.html) and [VLSI System Design (VSD) Corp.](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com) 

# Introduction

An Arithmetic logic unit (ALU) in a processor performs various arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and also performs logical operations like AND, OR etc. Most of the operations require only operands, but few operations require sub-modules along with operands. For example, multiplication operation is done by multiplying of data using AND gate and addition of partial products using full adders or half adders. It also requires a shifter to shift partial products so that they can be added in correct format. Hence these modules play an important role in characterizing the performance of processors. 

Different types of shifters available in digital electronics. They are basically sequential shifter such as serial shifters, parallel shifters which shifts or rotates data based on clock cycle of the processor. They require n clock cycles to shift n-data bits which are not beneficial in terms of performance of the processor. To overcome this problem, ALU‚Äòs are embedded with a module called Barrel shifter. A Barrel shifter as name suggests shits data either left or right based on the control shift bits configuration. It is usually consists of multiplexers connected parallel to each other. It works completely on combinational logic and shifts data in a single clock cycle. Due to its advantage, RISC processors use these barrel shifters embedded in ALU.
